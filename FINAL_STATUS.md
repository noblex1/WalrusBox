## 📦 Optional: Install Spline (Future Enhancement)

If you want to use actual Spline 3D scenes in the future:

```bash
npm install @splinetool/react-spline
```

Then update SplineScene.tsx to use the real Spline component. But for now, PlaceholderScene provides beautiful CSS-based 3D effects that work perfectly!
